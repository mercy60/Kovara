 * engagement needs more than 20 posts to rank, and too small a window would
 * make "top by engagement" silently mean "most engaged of the 20 newest".

 *
 *   GET /feed                        — ranked (engagement + recency)
 *   GET /feed?mode=recent            — newest first
 *   GET /feed?mode=trending          — engagement rate within a window
 *   GET /feed?author=<address>       — scope to one author
 *
 * The response echoes the ranking rules (weights, trending window) so the
 * order is explainable to a client without reading this file. An empty feed is
 * a `200` with `entries: []` and `candidate_count: 0` — an author with no posts
 * yet is a normal state, not a 404.
